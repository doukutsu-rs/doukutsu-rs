#### Data files

This repository does not contain any copyrighted files. 

For better user experience, AppVeyor builds are distributed with slightly modified freeware game files.

*doukutsu-rs* should work fine with pre-extracted and tweaked data files from [this repository](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/game-data), [NXEngine(-evo)](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo) extracted freeware data files and [Cave Story+](https://www.nicalis.com/games/cavestory+) data files.

Vanilla Cave Story does not work yet because some important data files have been embedded inside the executable. and we don't have a loader/extractor implemented yet.

##### Where to get them?

**Freeware**

- https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/game-data - Freeware game data distributed with CI builds, based on those two below.
- https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/releases/download/v2.6.4/NXEngine-v2.6.4-Win32.zip - copy `NXEngine-evo-2.6.4-xxx/data` from the archive to runtime directory

**Cave Story+ (not fully supported)**

- Original version (first released in 2011 on Steam)
  - PC release (Steam) - Copy `data` folder from installation directory ([guide for Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447682)) to the runtime directory.
  - PC release (Epic Games Store) - Essentially the same thing as with Steam version.
  - PC release (Humble Bundle) - Essentially the same thing as with Steam version.
  - PC release (GOG) - Essentially the same thing as with Steam version.
- Remastered version (first released in 2017 on Switch)
  - Switch release - (tested only with eShop version) Extract `data` directory from romfs. Requires a hacked console and a recent and legal copy of the game. If you don't know how, look in Google how to exactly do that because the methods really differ.
