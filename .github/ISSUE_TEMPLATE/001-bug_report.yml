        In case of a PC or Mac, the easiest way to get this is running a command in the command prompt or terminal app and pasting the output here.

        For Windows, run the following command in command prompt:
        ```powershell
        powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "& {Write-Host "`n`n--- BEGIN SYSTEM INFO ---^"; $os = Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $cpu = Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $computer = Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $gpus = Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; Write-Host ^"OS Version: $($os.Caption) $($os.OSArchitecture) Build $($os.BuildNumber)^"; Write-Host ^"CPU: $($cpu.Name)^"; Write-Host ^"Manufacturer: $($computer.Manufacturer)^"; Write-Host ^"Model: $($computer.Model)^"; Write-Host ^"RAM: $([Math]::floor($computer.TotalPhysicalMemory / 1MB)) MB^"; if ($gpus) { $i=1; foreach ($gpu in $gpus) { Write-Host ^"GPU $($i): $($gpu.Caption)^"; $i++ } } else { Write-Host 'GPU: Unknown' }; Write-Host ^"--- END SYSTEM INFO ---`n`n^"}"
        ```
        Or if you use PowerShell:
        ```powershell
        & {Write-Host "`n`n--- BEGIN SYSTEM INFO ---"; $os = Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $cpu = Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $computer = Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; $gpus = Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; Write-Host "OS Version: $($os.Caption) $($os.OSArchitecture) Build $($os.BuildNumber)"; Write-Host "CPU: $($cpu.Name)"; Write-Host "Manufacturer: $($computer.Manufacturer)"; Write-Host "Model: $($computer.Model)"; Write-Host "RAM: $([Math]::floor($computer.TotalPhysicalMemory / 1MB)) MB"; if ($gpus) { $i=1; foreach ($gpu in $gpus) { Write-Host "GPU $($i): $($gpu.Caption)"; $i++ } } else { Write-Host 'GPU: Unknown' }; Write-Host "--- END SYSTEM INFO ---`n`n"}
        ```

        For Linux, run the following command in terminal and paste the output here:
        ```bash
        printf "\n\n--- BEGIN SYSTEM INFO ---\n"; printf "OS Version: %s\n" "$(lsb_release -d -r -c 2>/dev/null | awk -F':\t' '{print $2}' | paste -s -d' ' || cat /etc/os-release 2>/dev/null | grep "PRETTY_NAME" | awk -F'=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '\"' || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "CPU Architecture: %s\n" "$(uname -m 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "CPU Model: %s\n" "$(lscpu 2>/dev/null | grep "Model name" | awk -F': *' '{print $2}' || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "RAM: %s MB\n" "$(grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo 2>/dev/null | awk '{print int($2 / 1024)}' || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "System Manufacturer/Model: %s\n" "$(cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_vendor 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown') $(cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "GPUs:\n%s\n" "$(lspci -vnn 2>/dev/null | grep -i 'VGA compatible controller\|3D controller' | awk -F': ' '{print "  - " $2}' | sed 's/ (rev .*//' || echo '  - Unknown')"; printf "--- END SYSTEM INFO ---\n\n\n"
        ```

        For macOS, run the following command in terminal and paste the output here:
        ```bash
        printf "\n\n--- BEGIN SYSTEM INFO ---\n"; printf "OS Version: %s %s\n" "$(sw_vers -productVersion 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown')" "$(sw_vers -buildVersion 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "CPU: %s\n" "$(sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string 2>/dev/null || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "RAM: %s MB\n" "$(sysctl -n hw.memsize 2>/dev/null | awk '{print int($1 / (1024*1024))}' || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "Manufacturer/Model: %s\n" "$(system_profiler SPHardwareDataType 2>/dev/null | awk '/Model Identifier/{print $3}' || echo 'Unknown')"; printf "GPUs:\n%s\n" "$(system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType 2>/dev/null | awk '/Chipset Model/{print "  - " $3}' | sed 's/  - Unknown//g' || echo '  - Unknown')"; printf "--- END SYSTEM INFO ---\n\n\n"
        ```
